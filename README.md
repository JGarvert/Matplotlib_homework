The power of plots

####Introduction: A study has been conducted on mice with tumors over the course of a period of time and various drug treatments.  Analyize the data to clean it, note outliers, and provide statstics.  There were 249 mice included in this study and 1,888 data points (mouse/time) were collected.
A subset study was done on the drug Capomulin with a sample mouse s185.

## Some observations:
1. The gender amonst mice (including time periods) is close to equal.

2. Infubinol had the only mouse with a quartile outlier.  While this doesn't necessarily indicate that Infubinol should be ruled out as a viable drug regmin for the study, it would infer that further investigation into that mouse would be helpful.

3. Capomulin has worked well for a single sample mouse.
